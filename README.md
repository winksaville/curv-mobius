# curv handling of mobius

I found that there is was a "gap" when combining twist, rotate and
 bend with a box to create a mobius strip.

I Posted a question on the curv googlegroup and Doug Meon
suggested using box.mitred but I still see a crease. Here is the
[post](https://groups.google.com/g/curv/c/GbOMxXE30Z8/m/vAKx7WMCAwAJ).

I then posted a question concerning seeing "beveled/rounded" edges
and maybe that was the problem, see [this post](https://groups.google.com/g/curv/c/7hMmGQFav7w/m/l_utiw-ZAwAJ).
